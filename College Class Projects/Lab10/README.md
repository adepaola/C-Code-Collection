- Lab 10 - File IO and Command Line Arguments  

This file contains four programs.
1) The first program creates a file with a name specified by the user. The user is
then prompted for 10 float values to save into the file.
2) The second program takes a file which contains float values as input. It then 
reads the floats into memory and uses the data to print the average, lowest, and highest
values.
3) The third program creates a file with a name specified by the user. The file is
then populated with 1000 random integers.
4) The fourth and final program takes a text file as input. It reads the text from the
file into memory and for each character it checks to see if it is an s, S, a, i, or H.
If the character is one of the specified, it is switched out with the special characters
$, @, !, or # respectfully.
