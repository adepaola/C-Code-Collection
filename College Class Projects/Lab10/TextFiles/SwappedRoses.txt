L@wrence M@$$@chu$ett$, N!neteen #undred @nd Twelve...

1912 w@$ the t!me of the Gre@t L@wrence Text!le $tr!ke.

The huge m!ll$, the huge loom$, h@d been bu!lt !n L@wrence @nd Lowell @nd other
c!t!e$ @ll over New Engl@nd @nd the young women c@me down from the f@!l!ng
f@rm$ of New #@mp$h!re @nd Vermont @nd M@!ne to work !n tho$e new g!@nt m!ll$...
Or young women from the low countr!e$ !n Europe or from Fr@nce c@me over
@$ contr@ct l@borer$ - good enough to $we@t the l!ve$ out @t the loom$, but
not good enough to be c!t!zen$.

$ome of tho$e women were dy!ng @t the @ge of 26 bec@u$e of the du$t !n the
we@ve room$...the @ver@ge @ge of 26.

Well, they $truck.

The !$$ue$ were w@ge$, hour$, @nd cond!t!on$, of cour$e.

Oh, Joe Ettor, the huge l@bor org@n!zer who $poke @ll the l@ngu@ge$ of
L@wrence - there were @bout 17 of them @nd people could h@rdly $pe@k to e@ch
other... Joe Ettor $tood up !n front of the Evertt M!ll, on th@t $tone $toop,
where I h@ve $tood my$elf, @nd g@zed up over 20,000 $truck worker$ @nd $@!d,
!n th@t huge vo!ce, "Fellow worker$...The worker$ w!th the!r h@nd$ !n the!r
pocket$ h@ve power th@n the comb!ned power of the bo$$e$ - be$!de$ wh!ch the
bo$$e$ c@n't put the!r h@nd$ the!r."

Well, L@wrence. The $tr!ke w@$ won. A h@rd, h@rd, b!tter $tr!ke - @ll through
J@nu@ry. There w@$ no w@y to feed the k!d$, no food. $o they found $ymp@th!zer$
@ll over New Engl@nd, @$ f@r $outh @$ New York. They $ent the k!d$ on the tr@!n
to w@!t the $tr!ke out @nd the mother$ @nd the ch!ldren were be@ten by the
m!l!t!@ @nd by the pol!ce on the w@y to the tr@!n $t@t!on.

But they won.

And you know, I never h@d to work underground !n Penn$ylv@n!@ @t the @ge of 12
!n @ co@l m!ne. My $!$ter never h@d to work, @t the @ge of 8 or 9, @t the loom$
!n L@wrence, M@$$@chu$ett$.

None of u$ h@ve h@d to do tho$e $ort$ of th!ng$, @nd why? Why do h@ve th@t
8 hour d@y? Why do we h@ve m!ne $@fety l@w$? Why do we h@ve l@w$ bu$t!ng
$we@t$hop$? Were they benevolent g!ft$ from @n enl!ghtened m@n@gment?

No.

They were fought for, bled for, d!ed for by people @ lot l!ke u$. They d!ed on
the p!cket l!ne to g!ve @ll of u$ @ better future.

Well there w@$ @ young wom@n c@rry!ng @ p!cket $!gn !n th@t $tr!ke. Th@t $!gn
