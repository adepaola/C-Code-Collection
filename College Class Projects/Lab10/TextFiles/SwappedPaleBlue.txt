***C@rl $@g@n, P@le Blue Dot: A V!$!on of the #um@n Future !n $p@ce***

...For u$ !t !$ d!fferent. Con$!der @g@!n @t th@t dot. Th@t'$ here. Th@t'$ home.
Th@t'$ u$.

On !t, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever he@rd of,
every hum@n be!ng who ever w@$, l!ved out the!r l!ve$. The @ggreg@te of our joy
@nd $uffer!ng, thou$@nd$ of conf!dent rel!g!on$, !deolog!e$, @nd econom!c
doctr!ne$, every hunter @nd for@ger, every hero @nd cow@rd, every cre@tor @nd
de$troyer of c!v!l!z@t!on, every k!ng @nd pe@$@nt, every young couple !n love,
every mother @nd f@ther, hopeful ch!ld, !nventor @nd explorer, every te@cher
of mor@l$, every corrupt pol!t!c!@n, every "$uper$t@r," every "$upreme le@der,"
every $@!nt @nd $!nner !n the h!$tory of our $pec!e$ l!ved there-on @ mote of
du$t $u$pended !n @ $unbe@m.

The E@rth !$ @ very $m@ll $t@ge !n @ v@$t co$m!c @ren@. Th!nk of the endle$$
cruelt!e$ v!$!ted by the !nh@b!t@nt$ of one corner of th!$ p!xel on the
$c@rcely d!$t!ngu!$h@ble !nh@b!t@nt$ of $ome other corner, how frequent the!r
m!$under$t@nd!ng$, how e@ger they @re to k!ll one @nother, how fervent the!r
h@tred$. Th!nk of the r!ver$ of blood $p!lled by @ll tho$e gener@l$ @nd
emperor$ $o th@t, !n glory @nd tr!umph, they could become the moment@ry m@$ter$
of @ fr@ct!on of @ dot.

Our po$tur!ng, our !m@g!ned $elf-!mport@nce, the delu$!on th@t we h@ve $ome
pr!v!leged po$!t!on !n the Un!ver$e, @re ch@llenged by th!$ po!nt of p@le l!ght.
Our pl@net !$ @ lonely $peck !n the gre@t envelop!ng co$m!c d@rk.
In our ob$cur!ty, !n @ll th!$ v@$tne$$, there !$ no h!nt th@t help w!ll come
from el$ewhere to $@ve u$ from our$elve$.

The E@rth !$ the only world known $o f@r to h@rbor l!fe. There !$ nowhere el$e,
@t le@$t !n the ne@r future, to wh!ch our $pec!e$ could m!gr@te. V!$!t, ye$.
$ettle, not yet. L!ke !t or not, for the moment the E@rth !$ where we m@ke our
$t@nd.
