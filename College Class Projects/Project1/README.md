This program plays a game of Nim between a computer and a human. 20-30
toothpicks are created, then the player and computer alternate taking away
1-3 toothpicks until none remain. After the pile has been depleted the user
is told whether they won or lost and then are prompted to play again.

## Compile instructions 

To compile the program type the following in the terminal 

```
make
```
To run the program, type the following in the terminal
```
./main.exe
``` 
Alternatively, the following command can be used to compile and run at the same time
```
make init
```

## Completion Statement
All requirements were met in this lab to the best of my understanding. The hardest part of this
assignment was to find a use for a non-int data type which I solved by making a char sentinel to keep playing.
