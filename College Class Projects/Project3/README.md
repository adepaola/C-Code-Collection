- Project 3 - Simpletron

This program allows users to program a Simpletron using the 
Simpletron Machine Language.

Note: The purpose of this project was to simulate assembly operations using C.

## Compile instructions 

To compile the program type the following in the terminal 

```
make
```
To run the program, type the following in the terminal
```
./main.exe
``` 
Alternatively, the following command can be used to compile and run at the same time
```
make init
```

## Completion Statement
All requirements were met in this lab to the best of my understanding. The most challenging
part of this lab was actually correctly writing the SML program. I also decided to split
the program across a few files because my main.c was getting mighty cluttered.
