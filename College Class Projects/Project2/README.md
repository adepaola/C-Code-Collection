This program reads a character from the user specifying the math operation they wish to perform.
The numbers required for the calculation are then read, the calculation is performed, and the
result is printed to the screen.

## Compile instructions 

To compile the program type the following in the terminal 

```
make
```
To run the program, type the following in the terminal
```
./main.exe
``` 
Alternatively, the following command can be used to compile and run at the same time
```
make init
```

## Completion Statement
All requirements were met in this lab to the best of my understanding. Most of my problems in this
lab came from small logic errors like using a < rather than >. These were quickly caught though after
obvious errors in the output.
