## Completion Statement
All requirements were met in this lab to the best of my understanding. When I first did
Lab 4 I created all the functions needed for Lab 5 without knowing I'd need to use them in the future.
I just had to move around some prints and change some data types to make it fit the Lab 5 requirements.
