Lawrence Massachusetts, Nineteen Hundred and Twelve...

1912 was the time of the Great Lawrence Textile Strike.

The huge mills, the huge looms, had been built in Lawrence and Lowell and other
cities all over New England and the young women came down from the failing
farms of New Hampshire and Vermont and Maine to work in those new giant mills...
Or young women from the low countries in Europe or from France came over
as contract laborers - good enough to sweat the lives out at the looms, but
not good enough to be citizens.

Some of those women were dying at the age of 26 because of the dust in the
weave rooms...the average age of 26.

Well, they struck.

The issues were wages, hours, and conditions, of course.

Oh, Joe Ettor, the huge labor organizer who spoke all the languages of
Lawrence - there were about 17 of them and people could hardly speak to each
other... Joe Ettor stood up in front of the Evertt Mill, on that stone stoop,
where I have stood myself, and gazed up over 20,000 struck workers and said,
in that huge voice, "Fellow workers...The workers with their hands in their
pockets have power than the combined power of the bosses - besides which the
bosses can't put their hands their."

Well, Lawrence. The strike was won. A hard, hard, bitter strike - all through
January. There was no way to feed the kids, no food. So they found sympathizers
all over New England, as far south as New York. They sent the kids on the train
to wait the strike out and the mothers and the children were beaten by the
militia and by the police on the way to the train station.

But they won.

And you know, I never had to work underground in Pennsylvania at the age of 12
in a coal mine. My Sister never had to work, at the age of 8 or 9, at the looms
in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

None of us have had to do those sorts of things, and why? Why do have that
8 hour day? Why do we have mine safety laws? Why do we have laws busting
sweatshops? Were they benevolent gifts from an enlightened managment?

No.

They were fought for, bled for, died for by people a lot like us. They died on
the picket line to give all of us a better future.

Well there was a young woman carrying a picket sign in that strike. That sign
said "We Want Bread Yes, but Roses Too" - so that became known as the Bread
and Roses Strike...

----------------

As we come marching, marching in the beauty of the day,
A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray,
Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses,
For the people hear us singing: "Bread and roses! Bread and roses!"
As we come marching, marching, we battle too for men,
For they are women's children, and we mother them again.
Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes;
Hearts starve as well as bodies; give us bread, but give us roses!
As we come marching, marching, unnumbered women dead
Go crying through our singing their ancient cry for bread.
Small art and love and beauty their drudging spirits knew.
Yes, it is bread we fight for—but we fight for roses, too!
As we come marching, marching, we bring the greater days.
The rising of the women means the rising of the race.
No more the drudge and idler—ten that toil where one reposes,
But a sharing of life's glories: Bread and roses! Bread and roses!
